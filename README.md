# Foresight Tech Tree

This is a build of the Tech Tree for Foresight Institute's Tech Tree Project. This tree is a living and growing structure: feel free to clone it, fork it, make pull requests, or otherwise edit it.

The current trees can be seen at:

- [Longevity](https://foresight.org/ext/ForesightTechTree/) ([for editors](https://foresight.org/ext/ForesightTechTree/editor.html))
- [Intelligent Cooperation](https://foresight.org/ext/ForesightIntcoopTree/) 
- [Nanotech](https://foresight.org/ext/ForesightNanotechTree/) ([for editors](https://foresight.org/ext/ForesightNanotechTree/editor.html))
- [Neurotech](https://foresight.org/ext/ForesightNeurotechTree/) ([for editors](https://foresight.org/ext/ForesightNeurotechTree/editor.html))
- [SpaceTech](https://foresight.org/ext/ForesightSpaceTree/) ([for editors](https://foresight.org/ext/ForesightSpaceTree/editor.html))

Soon, we will combine them in a single tree at:

- [All Tech Tree](https://foresight.org/ext/ForesightAllTree/) ([for editors](https://foresight.org/ext/ForesightAllTree/editor.html))
